## Erekir Reworked
A mod that *attempts* to try fill in the gaps between Erekir's progression. EXTREMELY UNORIGINAL,
this mod will absolutely not suit you properly if you dislike unoriginal content that does not
create a huge difference in the game, but instead to expand on it. May have balancing issues.
