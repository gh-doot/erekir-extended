## What is Erekir Extended?
Erekir Extended is a Mindustry mod that has a lot of unique improvements and particular upgrades to Erekir's content, introducing some few between two tiers of blocks like Plasma Bores, **Gamma Ray Bores**, and Large Plasma Bores, to upgrades such as Eruption Drills to **Cataclysmic** drills. Cursed concepts like Beam Nodes that have no particular direction, or entirely new mechanics such as the Boost Glimmerer and Steam!

## Why does it exist?
Preferrably, Erekir has a slow and slightly boring progression *in my opinion*, so I wanted to add some extra content to it and make it more interesting. If you think you want a more interesting, less game-changing mod that adds less rough bumps in Erekir but more smoother progression, then consider this mod.
